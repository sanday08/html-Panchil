                  The tree is small to medium in size, reaching 1–8 m (3 ft 3
                  in–26 ft 3 in) in height. The branchlets are not glabrous or
                  finely pubescent, 10–20 cm (3.9–7.9 in) long, usually
                  deciduous; the leaves are simple, subsessile and closely set
                  along branchlets, light green, resembling pinnate leaves.
                  The flowers are greenish-yellow. The fruit is nearly
                  spherical, light greenish-yellow, quite smooth and hard on
                  appearance, with six vertical stripes or furrows. Ripening
                  in autumn, the berries are harvested by hand after climbing
                  to upper branches bearing the fruits. The taste of Indian
                  emblic is sour, bitter and astringent, and it is quite
                  fibrous. In India, it is common to eat emblic steeped in
                  salt water and red chilli powder to make the sour fruits
                  palatable.

                  Custard apple is a common name for a fruit, and the tree
                  which bears it, Annona reticulata. The fruits vary in shape,
                  heart-shaped, spherical, oblong or irregular. The size
                  ranges from 7 centimetres (2.8 in) to 12 centimetres (4.7
                  in), depending on the cultivar. When ripe, the fruit is
                  brown or yellowish, with red highlights and a varying degree
                  of reticulation, depending again on the variety. The flesh
                  varies from juicy and very aromatic to hard with a repulsive
                  taste.The flavor is sweet and pleasant, akin to the taste of
                  'traditional' custard. The custard apple is native to the
                  New World, but has been found on the island of Timor in
                  Indonesia as early as 1000 C.E.

                  roots are long and unbranched and measure upto 8 meter in
                  length. The leaves have a set of interesting features to
                  notice. Color of young leaves vary between varieties. They
                  are generally tan-red, yellowish brown or pink in color when
                  young. They undergo a series of different shades as they
                  grow and finally are dark green when mature. The fruits are
                  fleshy, fibrous, and have a characteristic ‘beak’ which is a
                  small conical projection- special feature of mangoes. The
                  prominence of the projection varies between varieties.

                <h3>TECKTONA GRANDIES(TECK)</h3>
                <h6>About</h6>
                <p>
                  Tectona grandis is the source of a high quality general
                  purpose hardwood known as teak. The timber is used for ship
                  decking, flooring, furniture and construction. ... Teak has
                  traditionally been used in southeast Asia for medicine,
                  commonly for its astringent and diuretic properties and
                  against swelling. Teak's high oil content, high tensile
                  strength and tight grain make it particularly suitable where
                  weather resistance is desired. It is used in the manufacture
                  of outdoor furniture and boat decks. It is also used for
                  cutting boards, indoor flooring, countertops and as a veneer
                  for indoor furnishings. Although easily worked, it can cause
                  severe blunting on edged tools because of the presence of
                  silica in the wood. Over time teak can weather to a
                  silvery-grey finish, especially when exposed to sunlight
                  Teak is used extensively in India to make doors and window
                  frames, furniture, and columns and beams in old type houses.
                  It is resistant to termite attacks and damage caused by
                  other insects. Mature teak fetches a very good price. It is
                  grown extensively by forest departments of different states
                  in forest areas.

                  Sandalwood, any semiparasitic plant of the genus Santalum
                  (family Santalaceae), especially the fragrant wood of the
                  true, or white, sandalwood, Santalum album. The
                  approximately 10 species of Santalum are distributed
                  throughout southeastern Asia and the islands of the South
                  Pacific.Many other woods are used as substitutes for true
                  sandalwood. Red sandalwood is obtained from the
                  reddish-coloured wood of Pterocarpus santalinus, a Southeast
                  Asian tree of the pea family (Fabaceae). This species may
                  have been the source of the sandalwood used in King
                  Solomon’s temple.

                  of Cactaceae and is the most cultivated species in the
                  genus. It is used both as an ornamental vine and as a fruit

                  Mahogany trees can survive in USDA zones 9 through 11. They
                  grow to large heights and spreads, so you'll need to prepare
                  plenty of space for these fast-growing saplings at the time
                  of planting.Mahogany trees do best when planted in areas
                  that receive partial to full sun. Mahogany trees can grow in
                  a range of soil types, but they do thrive best in
                  well-drained sandy loam soils.Plant the tree at least 15
                  feet (4.57 m) away from any house or large structure. It
                  should also be 8 feet (2.43 m) or more away from sidewalks,
                  streets, and driveways.
